# scripts
**get-cred**: Python script that could be useful when you want to use passwords in scripts but don't want them to be compromised.__
Supported options are: get, store, update, delete.
I've also included a wrapper for this script in order to be able to import this script as library and call it as a function.
In this case you don't need to care of encoding of your password, it wll happen automatically.

 **nginx_parse.py**: Simple parser of nginx logs. It will show top 10 sources IP that sent most amount of traffic

 **projsync.py**: Simple script that sync Jira project element petween two projects.

 Will be more
