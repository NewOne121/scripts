# scripts
 get-cred: Python script that could be useful when you want to use passwords in scripts but don't want them to be compromised. You could import script to yuor code, or call it from script to get password. Supported options are: get, store, update, delete.
 I've also included a wrapper for this script in order to be able to call script as a function.

 nginx_parse.py: Simple parser of nginx logs. It will show top 10 sources IP that sent most amount of traffic

 projsync.py: Simple script that sync Jira project element petween two projects.

 Will be more
